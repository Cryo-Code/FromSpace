# FromSpace (Ludum Dare 45)

## [Play Here](https://cryo-code.github.io/FromSpace/Game/)

This is a typical enemy wave survival game that takes place on a single spacestation block which grows into a larger and harder to manage station requiring strategiec movement, timing, and a little bit of luck.

I made the game in Unity and all assets were authored during the Compo. Here are the tools I used:

VS Code: Text editor
Soundtrap: Music and sound FX.
Adobe XD: Images and textures. (I know it's strange, but I really like the workflow. .xd file included in source)
Unity 2D: 100% of the scripts were from scratch and are quite a mess.
